# BookDB
Beginner level, terminal based book database written in Python. It doesn't have any file saving utility. \
I made it for educational purposes. So please don't wait a future update please. You can do anything with the code.

# Usage
Just type `python bookdb.py` from terminal in the location of bookdb.py file.
